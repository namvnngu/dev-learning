# History of Coding

Throughout the human history, there are many encoding and decoding systems such as Rosetta Stone including Egyptian hieroglyphs (for Holy carving into stones) and Egyptian demotic (for daily things such as documents, commerce, etc.), which refer to the same language, binary, etc.

Binary can be simultaneously extremely simple, and with the power of computers can be also used to become extremely expressive through ending and decoding system.

In fact, the person who is credited for discovering binary is Gottfried Leibniz.

# Binary

Binary, base 2, is 0 and 1.
`0b` is a prefix that indicates "this value is binary, not decimal".

Left shifting multiples binary by 2. Right shifting divide binary by 2.

# Hex and Octal

Hex, base 16, is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F. `0x` is a prefix that indicates "this value is hex, not decimal".

Octal, base 8, is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. `0o` is a prefix that indicates "this value is octal, not decimal".
