# Memory

Memory is a big list of cells. Each cell has an address and a value that can be changed.

Everything in a computer on some level exists in the structure of the big list of numbers ([watch this](https://youtu.be/76acHVJfziw?t=1084))

# Instructions

An instruction is a symbol representing an operation.

Instructions both are memory and operate on memory. They that make programming programming and not electrical engineering. The idea is that sequences of operations can be expressed as data in memory.

# Syscalls

Syscalls are instructions a program gives to systems outside of itself. Typically, the operating system runs them.

# Functions

A function is a callable unit of code, typically taking some input in the form of arguments and returning some output as a return value, and sometimes having some side effects on other parts of a program or system.

Functions are an exceptionally powerful idea taken from mathematics and placed on top of software engineering.

# Structure

Structure comes from an idea called structured programming, contributed to the field by a computer scientist called, Edsger Dijkstra. He proposed that we write programs in a structure reflecting how we think of them, not as how the instructions really come out ([watch this](https://youtu.be/76acHVJfziw?t=2041)).

# Cognition

- Cognition is the mental processes used to solve the programming problems.
